    <string name="app_name" translatable="false">The Question</string>

    <string name="lecture1">It iss only when I hear the sounds of shuffling feet and supplies being put away that I realize that the lectures over.</string>
    <string name="lecture2">Professor Eileens lectures are usually interesting, but today I just couldnt concentrate on it.</string>
    <string name="lecture3">Ive had a lot of other thoughts on my mind… thoughts that culminate in a question.</string>
    <string name="lecture4">Its a question that I\'ve been meaning to ask a certain someone.</string>
    <string name="lecture5">When we come out of the university, I spot her right away.</string>
    <string name="lecture6">I have known Sylvie since we were kids. Shes got a big heart and she is always been a good friend to me.</string>
    <string name="lecture7">But recently… Ive felt that I want something more.</string>
    <string name="lecture8">More than just talking, more than just walking home together when our classes end.</string>
    <string name="lecture9">As soon as she catches my eye, I decide…</string>

    <string name="right1">1 Hi there! How was class?</string>
    <string name="right2">2 Good…</string>
    <string name="right3">I cant bring myself to admit that it all went in one ear and out the other.</string>
    <string name="right4">2 Are you going home now? Want to walk back with me?</string>
    <string name="right5">1 Sure!</string>
    <string name="right6">After a short while, we reach the meadows just outside the neighborhood where we both live.</string>
    <string name="right7">Its a scenic view Ive grown used to. Autumn is especially beautiful here.</string>
    <string name="right8">When we were children, we played in these meadows a lot, so they are full of memories.</string>
    <string name="right9">2 Hey… Umm…</string>
    <string name="right10">She turns to me and smiles. She looks so welcoming that I feel my nervousness melt away.</string>
    <string name="right11">I will ask her…!</string>
    <string name="right12">2 Ummm… Will you…</string>
    <string name="right13">2 Will you be my artist for a visual novel?</string>
    <string name="right14">Silence.</string>
    <string name="right15">She looks so shocked that I begin to fear the worst. But then…</string>
    <string name="right16">1 Sure, but whats a visual novel?</string>

    <string name="game1">2 Its a kind of video game you can play on your computer or a console.</string>
    <string name="game2">2 Visual novels tell a story with pictures and music.</string>
    <string name="game3">2 Sometimes, you also get to make choices that affect the outcome of the story.</string>
    <string name="game4">1 So its like those choose-your-adventure books?</string>
    <string name="game5">2 Exactly! Ive got lots of different ideas that I think would work.</string>
    <string name="game6">2 And I thought maybe you could help me…since I know how you like to draw.</string>
    <string name="game7">2 Itd be hard for me to make a visual novel alone.</string>
    <string name="game8">1 Well, sure! I can try. I just hope I dont disappoint you.</string>
    <string name="game9">2 You know you could never disappoint me, Sylvie.</string>

    <string name="book1">2 Its like an interactive book that you can read on a computer or a console.</string>
    <string name="book2">1 Interactive?</string>
    <string name="book3">2 You can make choices that lead to different events and endings in the story.</string>
    <string name="book4">1 So where does the visual part come in?</string>
    <string name="book5">2 Visual novels have pictures and even music, sound effects, and sometimes voice acting to go along with the text.</string>
    <string name="book6">1 I see! That certainly sounds like fun. I actually used to make webcomics way back when, so Ive got lots of story ideas.</string>
    <string name="book7">2 Thats great! So…would you be interested in working with me as an artist?</string>
    <string name="book8">1 Id love to!</string>

    <string name="marry1">And so, we become a visual novel creating duo.</string>
    <string name="marry2">Over the years, we make lots of games and have a lot of fun making them.</string>
    <string name="marry3">Our first game is based on one of Sylvies ideas, but afterwards I get to come up with stories of my own, too.</string>
    <string name="marry4">We take turns coming up with stories and characters and support each other to make some great games!</string>
    <string name="marry5">And one day…</string>
    <string name="marry6">1 Hey…</string>
    <string name="marry7">2 Yes?</string>
    <string name="marry8">1 Will you marry me?</string>
    <string name="marry9">2 What? Where did this come from?</string>
    <string name="marry10">1 Come on, how long have we been dating?</string>
    <string name="marry11">2 A while…</string>
    <string name="marry12">1 These last few years weve been making visual novels together, spending time together, helping each other…</string>
    <string name="marry14">2 Sylvie…</string>
    <string name="marry13">1 Ive gotten to know you and care about you better than anyone else. And I think the same goes for you, right?</string>
    <string name="marry15">1 But I know youre the indecisive type. If I held back, who knows when you propose?</string>
    <string name="marry17">1 So will you marry me?</string>
    <string name="marry18">2 Of course I will! Ive actually been meaning to propose, honest!</string>
    <string name="marry19">1 I know, I know.</string>
    <string name="marry20">2 I guess… I was too worried about timing. I wanted to ask the right question at the right time.</string>
    <string name="marry21">1 You worry too much. If only this were a visual novel and I could pick an option to give you more courage!</string>
    <string name="marry22">We get married shortly after that.</string>
    <string name="marry23">Our visual novel duo lives on even after were married…and I try my best to be more decisive.</string>
    <string name="marry24">Together, we live happily ever after even now.</string>
    <string name="marry25">Good Ending</string>

    <string name="badEnd1">I cant get up the nerve to ask right now. With a gulp, I decide to ask her later..</string>
    <string name="badEnd2">But Im an indecisive person.</string>
    <string name="badEnd3">I couldnt ask her that day and I end up never being able to ask her.</string>
    <string name="badEnd4">I guess Ill never know the answer to my question now…</string>
    <string name="badEnd5">Bad Ending</string>
    <string name="exit">Exit</string>
